== PROJECT: Tasketch


== Overview

My teammates and I developed Tasketch for those who need to manage their time by allocating time for each daily task. More importantly, our Tasketch is optimized for those who prefer to use a desktop app and work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)

== Summary of contributions

This part shows my individual contributions to our project Tasketch.

* *Major enhancement*: I have added the *reminder feature* to our Tasketch.
** What it does: Sometimes student tend to forget important deadline of their tasks or start time of their CCA events and etc. When users type in remind command, Tasketch will show a list of tasks in time order for them to conveniently view what tasks are coming soon so that they will know what to prepare first.
** Justification: For busy university students, it is almost impossible for them to remember every start time or deadlines of their activities. A reminder is a common requirement of them to easily view these time in order. This feature significantly improves the users' using experience by meeting this requirement.
** Highlights:
*** The task cards in the remind list are filled with different colors according to those tasks' urgency level. It is very striking for users to view and consequently have a good effect on reminding users. +
*** This feature implement a very useful method sort() in model API which can be used to implement other features.


* *Minor enhancement*: I made an enhancement to the list command of the previous version. In the previous version, list command can only list all the tasks in the storage. After enhancement, it support the following 4 kind of usages:

****
* 1. *list* - list all the tasks in Tasketch.
* 2. *list td* - list all the tasks of today.
* 3. *list [Date]* - list all the tasks of the specified date. The date can be accurate to day or month.
* 4. *list [Category]* - list all the tasks of the specified category.
****

=== Listing all tasks : `list`/`l`

Shows a list of tasks in Tasketch.

Format:


* `list` +
Lists all the tasks in the storage +

* `list td` +
List all the tasks whose start date is today +

* `list DATE` +
Lists all the tasks whose start date is that specific date +

* `list CATEGORY` +
Lists all the tasks of the specified category.

Examples:

* `list a` +
Lists all the tasks of academic category.
* `list 02-19` +
Lists all the tasks which starts in February, 2019
* `list 20-02-19` +
Lists all the tasks which starts on February 20th, 2019
* `list` +
Lists all the tasks in the storage


=== Reminding the users of the nearest task : `remind`

Shows to the user the nearest tasks of certain category.

Format:

* `remind start` +
Reminds the users of the most recently begin tasks of all categories. The reminded tasks should be in colored task cards.
+

* `remind ddl` +
Remind the users of the most recent deadline of all categories. The reminded tasks should be in colored task cards. +

[NOTE]
"a" - Academic +
"e" - Entertainment +

=== Reminder feature

This feature will show user a remind list when remind command is requested. The remind list is a task list sorted by start time or deadline.

==== Current Implementation

We maintain a reminder list in each model. Note that each time user can ask for any category of tasks to be reminded, which means the remind list should contains all the tasks in Tasketch to be filtered. When the app runs, remind list will be initialised to be a **FXCollections list** of all the tasks in Tasketch.

Remind feature has two formats of command:

* a) `remind [start/ddl]`
* b) `remind [category] [start/ddl]`

they follows the following steps:

** **Step 1** : **Sort remind list.** +
*** When `remind [start/ddl]` is requested, **sortRemindListByStart() / sortRemindListByEnd()** will be called. These two method will sort the remind list by start time or deadline of a task.
*** When `remind [category] [start/ddl]` is requested, Tasketh will first do the same thing as described above. In addition, it will call **filterRemindList()** method to filter the remind list to contain only tasks with the specified category.
** **Step 2** : **Update the UI.** +
The UI part of reminder is managed by **ReminderPane** class. After remind list is sorted. We update the UI of reminder in **MainWindow** by calling **setReminder()** method. **setReminder()** is implemented using **ReminderPane**.

** **Step 3** : **Re-initialize remind list.** +
Call **reinitialzeRemindList()** method in **MainWindow** to set remind list to be a FXCollections list of all the tasks.

[NOTE]
The reason of doing this is when we show the remind list in UI, we change it from FXCollections list to a Observable list. However, in current implementation, sorting method can only be applied to FXCollections list. So we need to re-initialize remind list to be a FXCollections list containing all the tasks after each call of remind command.

==== Design Consideration

* **Alternative 1:** Use filteredTaskList as the remind list and all operations which are related to reminder are done to filteredTaskList.
** Pros: Very easy to implement.
** Cons: It is not user friendly. When user execute command like "list", "filteredTaskList" will change and as a result the remind list will also change. However, remind list is expected to be concise and up-to-date. It should point to all tasks in storage instead of filteredTaskList and only change when commands like "add" and "delete" are executed.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement a separate remind list in model and maintain the remind list whenever the tasks in storage change.
** Pros: It is user friendly. As long as users don't change the tasks in the storage, remind list will remain the same. When users make change to tasks, remind command will update remind list.
** Cons: Hard to implement. Developers need to implement a separate bunch of methods in logic and model interface and class to maintain the remind list.
