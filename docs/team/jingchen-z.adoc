== PROJECT: Tasketch

---
Hello there~! :)

This is Jingchen from the `Tasketch` project team. This project is under National University of Singapore, School of Computing's module CS2113T and CS2101. My teammates and I aim to create a software which helps NUS students manage their time properly. This portfolio serves to document my work on Tasketch.

== Overview

image::Ui.png[width="1000"]

`Tasketch` is a *time management* software aiming to help NUS students who need to manage their time by allocating time to daily tasks. More importantly, `Tasketch` is optimized for those who prefer to use a desktop app and work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
`Tasketch` is morphed from `addressbook-level4` by 5 students, namely *Cheah Zhi Kang*, *Jin Shibo*, *Li Zeyang*, *Wan Chunwei* (my teammates) and *Zhang Jingchen*(me).

== Summary of contributions

* *Main enhancement*: Enhance visual feedback with timeline feature.
** What it does: It arranges the tasks on a given day into a timeline according to their categories and display the timelines in parallel.
** Justification: By visually showing the arranged timeline, this feature helps the user to better manage their tasks and decide on time allocation.
** Highlights: Each category timeline will have their own color to be distinguished.
** Credits: _{Shibo's idea is used on filtering the tasks according to date}_

* *Other enhancement*: Added command for changing calendar. Changed the find and history command that allows the user to easily locate a task and see history commands.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=Jingchen&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-01&timeframe=day&reverse=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabAuthor=jingchen-z&tabRepo=CS2113-AY1819S2-T09-2_main_master&repoSort=true[Functional code]] [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#search=&sort=displayName&since=2019-02-10&until=2019-04-01&timeframe=day&reverse=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false&tabAuthor=jingchen-z&tabRepo=CS2113-AY1819S2-T09-2_main_master[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T09-2/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[../UserGuide.adoc]

== View calender & timeline

=== Set the calendar to desired month : `month`

Shows the desired month to the user. Noted that only previous month and next month will be shown. +
e.g. Current month is April, then only March and May can be shown.

[TIP]
The feature for changing the background color of each day on the calendar will come in v2.0!

Format:

* `month +` +
Changes the current calendar to next month. +
+
image::month_plus.png[width="400"]

* `month -` +
Changes the current calendar to previous month.

* `month` +
Show current month's calendar.
+
image::month_this.png[width="400"]

=== Shows the timeline of a specific day to the user : `timeline` +
`timeline` command will arrange the tasks on one day to real timelines.

Noted that if there are multiple tasks at the same time under same category, the timeline will only display one task name and time period.
e.g Academic task1: 12:00-14:00, Academic task2: 12:00-15:00 (in one day). The academic timeline will only show 12:00-15:00 is reserved.

* `timeline` +
Shows the timeline of today by default. +

* `timeline [DATE]` +
Shows the timeline of that date. +

[NOTE]
After adding or editing a task, user needs to retype `timeline [DATE]` to refresh the timeline. +
This implementation is to make sure this feature is not purely part of UI.


Examples:

* `timeline` +
Shows the timeline for today.
+
image::timeline_today.png[width="790"]

* `timeline 01-04-19` +
Shows the whole timeline for 1st April 2019.
+
image::timeline_date.png[width="790"]

[TIP]
Timeline will only show the tasks between 6:00am to 24:pm. Sleeping early is a good habit~


=== Searching tasks by keywords: `find`/`f`

Finds tasks whose topic or description contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `search KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] ...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `Tutorial` will match `tutorial`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS2113T tutorial` will match `tutorial CS2113T`.
* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `tut` will not match `tutorial`.
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `CS2113T tutorial` will return `CS2113T lecture`, `CS3235 tutorial`.
****

Examples:

* `find CS2113T` +
Returns `CS2113T lecture`
* `f Lecture` +
Returns `CS2113T lecture` and `CS3235 lecture`

=== Deleting a task : `delete`/`d`

Deletes the specified task from Tasketch.

Format: `delete INDEX_NUMBER`

****
* Each tasks is identified by the index number shown in the task list.
* Deletes the task with the index number.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the task with index number 1 in task list.
* `find cs2113t` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the task with index number 1 in task list.

=== Effective Visualization feature

==== Current Implementation
There are mainly two parts in this features, **calendar** and **timeline arrangement**

These two parts will help the user better arrange their time usage by visualization of time.

* **There are currently two commands with parameters to help achieve this, `month` and `timeline`.**

** **Implementation for Calendar: ** Using `GridPane` to separate the whole calendar area into 35 grids.

*** Each one of the 35 grids is filled with PaneNode which is defined as area for a day.
*** PaneNode extends AnchorPane.

***

** **Implementation for Timeline:** Using JavaFx and segment each part of the browserPanel.

*** First, separate the whole `browserPanel` into 2 parts: `upperPane` and `timelinePane`.
*** Second, separate the `upperPane` into `calendarPane` and `reminderPane`.
*** The whole implementation of `timeline` is in `timelinePane` using JavaFx.
*** The overall structure is JavaFx VBox, which is a vertical arrangement structure.
*** Inside the VBox, there are key time points for interval of 2 hours. Then the timeline for each category.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How timeline executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete current timeline area and re-render timeline.
** Pros: Easy to implement. User has the freedom to choose which day to display.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of execution and computation power.
* **Alternative 2:** The timeline is auto-updated after each `add` or `edit` command.
** Pros: More intuitive to use.
** Cons: User lost the freedom to choose which day to display the timeline.

===== Aspect: Special Data structure to support timeline commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a 2-D array to store of PreTask objects instead of using Task objects.
** Pros: Saves memory since filtering requires a copy of task details.
** Cons: Similar class is created.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a 2-D array to store Task objects.
** Pros: More intuitive and easy to implement since no new class is created.
** Cons: Requires more memory and computation power.
