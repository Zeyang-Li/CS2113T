== PROJECT: Tasketch

---
Hello there~!:)

This is Jingchen from the `Tasketch` project team. This project is under National University of Singapore, School of Computing's module CS2113T. My teammates and I aim to create a software which helps NUS students manage their time properly. This portfolio serves to document my work on Tasketch.

== Overview

image::Ui.png[width="1000"]

`Tasketch` is a *time management* software aiming to help NUS students who need to manage their time by allocating time to daily tasks. More importantly, `Tasketch` is optimized for those who prefer to use a desktop app and work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). +
`Tasketch` is morphed from `addressbook-level4` by 5 students, namely *Cheah Zhi Kang*, *Jin Shibo*, *Li Zeyang*, *Wan Chunwei* (my teammates) and *Zhang Jingchen*(me).

== Summary of contributions

* *Main enhancement*: Enhance visual feedback with timeline feature.
** What it does: It arranges the tasks on a given day into a timeline according to their categories and display the timelines in parallel.
** Justification: By visually showing the arranged timeline, this feature helps the user to better manage their tasks and decide on time allocation.
** Highlights: Each category timeline will have their own color to be distinguished.
** Credits: _{Shibo's idea is used on filtering the tasks according to date}_

* *Other enhancement*: Added command for changing calendar. Changed the find and history command that allows the user to easily locate a task and see history commands.

== Contributions to the User Guide


|===
|_Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S2-T09-2/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[../UserGuide.adoc]

== View calender & timeline

=== Set the calendar to desired month : `month`

Shows the desired month to the user. Noted that only previous month and next month will be shown. +
e.g. Current month is April, then only March and May can be shown.

[TIP]
The feature for changing the background color of each day on the calendar will come in v2.0!

Format:

* `month +` +
Changes the current calendar to next month. +
+
image::month_plus.png[width="400"]

* `month -` +
Changes the current calendar to previous month.

* `month` +
Show current month's calendar.
+
image::month_this.png[width="400"]

=== Shows the timeline of a specific day to the user : `timeline` +

* `timeline` +
Shows the timeline of today by default. +

* `timeline [DATE]` +
Shows the timeline of that date. +

[NOTE]
After adding or editing a task, user needs to retype `timeline [DATE]` to refresh the timeline. +
This implementation is to make sure this feature is not purely part of UI.


Examples:

* `timeline` +
Shows the timeline for today.
+
image::timeline_today.png[width="790"]

* `timeline 01-04-19` +
Shows the whole timeline for 1st April 2019.
+
image::timeline_date.png[width="790"]


=== Searching tasks by keywords: `find`/`f`

Finds tasks whose topic or description contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `search KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] ...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `Tutorial` will match `tutorial`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `CS2113T tutorial` will match `tutorial CS2113T`.
* Only the description is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `tut` will not match `tutorial`.
* Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `CS2113T tutorial` will return `CS2113T lecture`, `CS3235 tutorial`.
****

Examples:

* `find CS2113T` +
Returns `CS2113T lecture`
* `f Lecture` +
Returns `CS2113T lecture` and `CS3235 lecture`

=== Deleting a task : `delete`/`d`

Deletes the specified task from Tasketch.

Format: `delete INDEX_NUMBER`

****
* Each tasks is identified by the index number shown in the task list.
* Deletes the task with the index number.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the task with index number 1 in task list.
* `find cs2113t` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the task with index number 1 in task list.

=== Effective Visualization feature

==== Current Implementation
There are mainly two parts in this features, **calendar** and **timeline arrangement**

These two parts will help the user better arrange their time usage by visualization of time.

* **There are currently two commands with parameters to help achieve this, `month` and `timeline`.**

** **Implementation for Calendar: ** Using `GridPane` to separate the whole calendar area into 35 grids.

*** Each one of the 35 grids is filled with PaneNode which is defined as area for a day.
*** PaneNode extends AnchorPane.

***

** **Implementation for Timeline:** Using JavaFx and segment each part of the browserPanel.

*** First, separate the whole `browserPanel` into 2 parts: `upperPane` and `timelinePane`.
*** Second, separate the `upperPane` into `calendarPane` and `reminderPane`.
*** The whole implementation of `timeline` is in `timelinePane` using JavaFx.
*** The overall structure is JavaFx VBox, which is a vertical arrangement structure.
*** Inside the VBox, there are key time points for interval of 2 hours. Then the timeline for each category.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How timeline executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete current timeline area and re-render timeline.
** Pros: Easy to implement. User has the freedom to choose which day to display.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of execution and computation power.
* **Alternative 2:** The timeline is auto-updated after each `add` or `edit` command.
** Pros: More intuitive to use.
** Cons: User lost the freedom to choose which day to display the timeline.

===== Aspect: Special Data structure to support timeline commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a 2-D array to store of PreTask objects instead of using Task objects.
** Pros: Saves memory since filtering requires a copy of task details.
** Cons: Similar class is created. 
* **Alternative 2:** Use a 2-D array to store Task objects.
** Pros: More intuitive and easy to implement since no new class is created.
** Cons: Requires more memory and computation power.
