== Introduction

Tasketch is an application that helps you to manage your everyday task by giving you an overview of all the time planned
for all the tasks in a daily manner. It also helps you to be aware of all the task deadlines too. +

This application is designed for the busy NUS students who have many tasks, assignments and deadlines everyday. +

Tasketch uses minimal (GUI) elements, instead opting for a faster Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the
benefits of the GUI. So, if you are used to the command line, Tasketch is sure to help manage your time effectively. +

This user guide will introduce the features of Tasketch and show you how to use all the command lines. +
Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== How to use this guide
There are several terms which we use throughout the guide. To make your understanding clearer, you can read the following
section to ensure that you are able to use this user guide to the fullest.

=== Command Format

* Some commands have an alias, which you can also use to execute the command e.g. to add a task to Tasketch, you can
type either `add` or `a`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Do MA1101R tutorial`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `sd/START_DATE ed/END_DATE`, `ed/END_DATE sd/START_DATE` is also acceptable.
* The format for dates is `dd-mm-yy`. For example: `25-03-19` means March 25th, 2019.
* The format for times is `hh.mm` and it is using 24-hour clock. For example: `13.00` means 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

[[category]]
****
* There are only 5 valid categories for each task: +
*** a - Academic
*** e - Entertainment
*** c - Co-Curicullar Activity (CCA)
*** r - Errands
*** o - Others
** Any inputs other than the above will be invalid.
** The time duration displayed for each category is in hours and minutes unit. (e.g. 1.0 for 1 hour, 1.15 for 1 hour 15 minutes)
****

== Daily Time Planner

This feature will help you to monitor the time planned for different tasks in a day. By looking at the time spent on
different tasks, it aims to help you to plan your time better so that you will not spend most time on specific type
of a task.

=== Adding a task: `add`/`a`

To get started, you will need to add a task into Tasketch. The format is as below. +

When you are adding a task, the app will ensure that there will be no duplicate names added. This is to ensure that
there is no confusion in the task names.

[TIP]
Tasks can overlap each other, meaning you can have 2 tasks planned at the same period, as you can multitask.

Adding a task with the same start date and end date means that it is a daily task, will be monitored by the Daily Time
Planner. Different dates means it is a long period task, thus will not be considered as daily task but can still be added.

The app will not able to verify the correctness for the number of days in different months, so you have to ensure that
the date exists in that particular month. However, the app will able to differentiate the maximum number of days and months.
This means that you will never be able to enter more than 31 days and more than 12 months in the start date and end date. +
Should you enter different start date and end date, the app will ensure that your end date is after the start date.

As for start time and end time, the app is smart enough to inform you when you have entered invalid time, such as 24.00,
as this is incorrect. You will not able to enter hours beyond 23 and minutes beyond 59. The app will also ensure
that the end time is after start time too. This to ensure the time spent/duration calculation (end time - start time)
will result correct values. There are only 5 valid categories. (The details about it can be found in <<category>>.)

You will also need to specify the type of category of the task that you are adding for the Daily Time Planner to monitor
your time effectively.

[TIP]
A task can have any number of tags (including 0).

[NOTE]
If any of the above is violated, the app will alert you that it is an invalid command with the correct format shown to
you. +
 +
image:InvalidCommand.png[]

Format: `add n/TASK_NAME sd/START_DATE st/START_TIME ed/END_DATE et/END_TIME d/DESCRIPTION c/CATEGORIES [t/TAG][t/TAG]`

Examples:

* `add n/CS2113 task sd/13-03-19 st/12.00 ed/13-03-19 et/14.00 d/Talk about version control c/a` +
Adds a task named CS2113 task in the app. It starts at 12:00 on March 13rd, 2019 and it ends at 14:00 on the same day.
The description for this task is to talk about version control and its category is academic.
* `add n/MA1101R tutorial sd/14-03-19 st/12.00 ed/14-03-19 et/14.00 d/Tutorial 8 c/a` +
Adds a task named MA1101R tutorial. It starts at 12:00 on March 14th, 2019 and ends at 14:00 on the same day.

* `add n/CS3235 lecture sd/13-03-19 st/08.00 ed/14-03-19 et/10.00 d/Talk about network security c/a t/important` +
Adds a task named CS3235 lecture. It starts at 8:00 on March 13rd, 2019 and ends at 10:00 on March 14th, 2019.
Its description is to talk about network security and the category is academic. The tag for it is 'important'.

Result: +
You should see the task added into the Task Box. (e.g. added a task on 15-03-19) +
image:TaskBox.png[] +

The time duration on that task will be calculated at the back and the time will be reflected in the Day Box. +
image:DayBox.png[]

=== Clearing tasks : `clear`/`c`

If you have done with the tasks, simply clear them from the Tasketch, so that they will not disrupt your time planning.

Format:

`delete 1` +
Deletes the task with index number 1 in task list.
* `find cs2113t` +
`delete 1` +
 Deletes the task with index number 1 in task list.

=== Editing a task : `edit`/`e`

Sometimes, you might have added a task information wrongly or wish to change its information. This command will allow you to
edit all existing tasks in Tasketch.

Since the Daily Time Planner only includes tasks that start and end on the same date. Editing the start date and end date
of a task will also lead to some changes.

1. Changing from same start and end date to different dates will remove the task from Daily Time Planner, its corresponding
time duration will also be deducted.

2. Changing from different start and end date to same dates will make it a daily task, thus to be included into the Daily
Time Planner, its corresponding time duration will also be added.

3. Maintaining the same start and end dates but changed the start or end time of a task. Its time duration changes will
also be updated in the Daily Time Planner.

Format: `edit TASK_ID [n/NAME] [st/START_TIME] [et/END_TIME] [d/DESCRIPTION]`

****
* Edits the task with the index number shown in the task list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing description, the existing description of the task will be removed.
****

* `edit 1 st/12.00 et/14.00 t/GET1018` +
Edits the start time and end time of the task with ID 1 to be `12.00` and `14.00` respectively. Change the topic to `GET1018`.

Result: +
The information edited for that task will be updated and reflected in the Task Box. +
The day related to that edited task will be updated and reflected in the Day Box.

=== Searching tasks by keywords: `find`/`f`

Finds tasks whose topic or description contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `search KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] ...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `Tutorial` will match `tutorial`.

[TIP]
Timeline will only show the tasks between 6:00am to 24:pm. Sleeping early is a good habit~

== Getting wrong command suggestions
There so many commands in the app, so to help you to use the app easier, it will tell you what you have typed wrongly automatically,
by giving a list of closest approximations of word through the message box after pressing `enter`. +

****
* The input is not case sensitive, hence it would increase the chance of getting a closer approximation of the correct command!
* This feature tolerates a maximum of two wrong alphabets.
* This feature allows user to type in a command which has the same alphabets with one of the correct command word but in different order. The system can give suggestion even if the user type in the reverse command word.
****

Examplesï¼š

* If you want to type `clear` but typed `clarr` instead, the system will tell you that it is an unknown command, and would suggest the command `clear` instead.
+
image::WrongCommandSuggestion_clarr.png[width="790"]
+
* If you want to type `exit` but typed `ecot` instead, the system will tell you that it is an unknown command, and would suggest the command `exit` and `edit` instead.
+
image::WrongCommandSuggestion_ecot.png[width="790"]
+
* If you want to type `history` but typed `hsitryo` instead, the system will tell you that it is an unknown command, and would suggest the command `history` instead.
Although there are more than 2 alphabets different from the correct command, the system will smartly show the suggestion because `hsitryo` has the same alphabets with `history`
+
image::WrongCommandSuggestion_hsitryo.png[width="790"]

== Automatically complete input command for user
If you type something wrongly, the app will automatically correct type error and fulfill their incomplete typed command in command line.

****
* The input is not case sensitive.
* If you type a string that is a substring of one of the commands, then command line will fulfill the string with this command.
* If you type a string that is not a substring of any of the commands, then command line will show the most similar command compared this string.
* if you type a string can not match any command, then command line will show `No command matched`.
****

Examplesï¼š

* If you want to type `list`, you can type `li` instead, and press `TAB` on keyboard. The system will automatically fulfill the command in command line with `list`.
* If you want to type `history`, but you type `histoe` instead, and press `tap` on keyboard. The system will automatically fulfill the command line with `history`.
* If you want to type `add`, but you type `aefw` instead, and press `tap` on keyboard. The system will automatically fulfill the command line with `No command matched`.

== Import/Export
This feature allows you to import an existing json file which contains your other tasks in Tasketch. Also, it supports
the product to export what you have in the Tasketch to a json file if you want.


=== Export tasks displayed: `export`
You can save all tasks or filtered tasks into a json file. It can be used with `list` or `find`. +
Format: `export FILENAME.json [CATEGORY]`

Examples:

* `find Revise` +
  `export revise.json` +
   Exports all tasks which are named with keyword "Revise" in revise.json.
* `export academic.json a` +
   Exports all academic tasks into academic.json.

  `export 13-03-19.json` +
   Exports all tasks which starts on March 13, 2019 in 13-03-19.json.
*  `export Tasketch.json` +
   Exports all tasks which are shown on the left list in Tasketch.json.

[NOTE]
====
1.  The file will be located in *<DIRECTORY OF YOUR JAR FILE>/data/FILENAME.json*
2.  This command overwrites any files with the same name at *<DIRECTORY OF YOUR JAR FILE>/data/*
3.  If you export tasks based on categories, the left list will also change to show all tasks which are exported.
====

=== Import tasks: `import`
If you have a classmate who have the same module with you, and you forget to add any related
task into Tasketch. There are a brunch of tasks in this module. In this case, you do not
need to add them one by one. Instead, you can simply ask your friend to export all tasks about this module and send the
file to you. What you have to do is just simply import it.


Format: `import FILENAME.json`

Examples:

* `import revise.json` +
   Imports all tasks in revise.json into Tasketch.

[NOTE]
====
1.  The file to import must be placed in *<DIRECTORY OF YOUR JAR FILE>/data/*
2.  Tasks that already exist in your Tasketch wonâ€™t be imported. To import an existing task in Tasketch with different details, please `delete` it first.
